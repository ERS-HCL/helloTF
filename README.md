Nowadays, there is a great market for machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts, as it is a niche technology, but it also requires different programming skillset.

There are plenty of tools and libraries available for this like Numpy, Keras, and TensorFlow, but most of them play around R, MATLAB, and, of course, Python.

So, now the problem is reskilling the existing programmer community, which is typically trained on languages like C, C++, and Java.

There is lots of misconception that TensorFlow is made only for Python and its allies. Don't worry, if you are an experienced Java/JS programmer and want to get your hands dirty with ML/DL, you still can!

The solution is [TensorFlow for Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/package-summary) and [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/).

You can enhance your learning for specific platform using these tutorials.
